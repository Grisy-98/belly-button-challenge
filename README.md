## Description

In this challenge, I was tasked to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that conolize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species, which are refered to as operational taxonomic units (OTU) in the study, were present in more than 70% of people. The rest were relatively rare.
